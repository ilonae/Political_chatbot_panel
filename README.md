# Section 1: Introduction - Political AI Chatbot Panel ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

This is a WIP for an exhibition about fascism - incorporating a GPT-based discussion partner for user interaction, while two moderators (philosopher and psychologist) analyze the interaction - all using the OpenAI API. Served with Flask and rendering a web GUI using React and Typescript, the application enables user-friendly web-based interaction (incorporating VoiceOver).
